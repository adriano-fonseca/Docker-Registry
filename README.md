# Docker-Registry

This is Docker Private Registry configuration that uses NGINX to provide HTTPS protocol and a Basic Authentication with Apache2 Utils through
htpasswd. I have tried to find a simple web interface to manage de images pushed to the registry. Unfortunately without success until the moment.
My last try was the [docker-registry-web](https://github.com/mkuchin/docker-registry-web/), but it didn't work, there is a issue register there and 
I am waiting for some feedback.
